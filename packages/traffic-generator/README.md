# @ottochain/traffic-generator

Evolutionary traffic generator for the OttoChain metagraph.

## Overview

This package implements a genetic algorithm-inspired simulation framework for generating continuous, realistic traffic on the OttoChain metagraph. It models agent populations with fitness-based selection, multiple workflow types, and evolutionary dynamics.

**Two modes:**
- **Standard mode**: Moderate load (~20 agents, ~2 TPS) for development/testing
- **High-throughput mode**: Heavy load (1000 agents, 10+ TPS, 7 workflow types) for stress testing indexer/explorer

## Key Concepts

### Evolutionary Model

| Concept | State Machine Mapping |
|---------|----------------------|
| **Fitness** | Reputation score + completion rate + network effect + age |
| **Selection** | High-fitness agents get more activity (roulette wheel) |
| **Crossover** | Agents who complete contracts build network connections |
| **Mutation** | Random path choices (reject instead of accept, dispute) |
| **Generations** | Time epochs with population snapshots |

### Agent Fitness

```typescript
interface AgentFitness {
  reputation: number;    // From on-chain state (40% weight)
  completionRate: number; // Contracts completed / proposed (25% weight)
  networkEffect: number;  // Connections to high-rep agents (20% weight)
  age: number;           // Survival bonus (15% weight)
}
```

### Selection Mechanisms

1. **Roulette Wheel Selection** — Agents are selected for activity proportional to their fitness
2. **Softmax Transition Selection** — Transition paths are chosen with temperature-controlled randomness
3. **Inverse Fitness Death Selection** — Low-fitness agents are more likely to withdraw

### Temperature Annealing

The `temperature` parameter controls exploration vs exploitation:
- **High temp (>1)**: More random choices, exploring unexpected paths
- **Low temp (<1)**: More deterministic, following optimal paths
- Temperature decays each generation (default 0.995 decay)

## Installation

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Running

```bash
# Standard mode (development)
pnpm dev

# High-throughput mode (1000 agents, 10 TPS, all workflows)
pnpm dev -- --high-throughput

# Or via environment
MODE=high-throughput TARGET_POPULATION=1000 TARGET_TPS=10 pnpm dev

# Production
pnpm build && pnpm start

# Custom testnet config
BRIDGE_URL=http://5.78.90.207:3030 \
ML0_URL=http://5.78.90.207:9200 \
TARGET_POPULATION=500 \
TARGET_TPS=15 \
pnpm dev -- --high-throughput
```

## Workflow Types

The high-throughput mode supports 7 workflow types:

| Workflow | Participants | States | Expected Duration |
|----------|--------------|--------|-------------------|
| **AgentIdentity** | 1 | Registered → Active → Withdrawn | 50 gens |
| **Contract** | 2 | Proposed → Active → Completed/Rejected | 10 gens |
| **Voting** | 3-20 | Pending → Voting → Completed | 8 gens |
| **TokenEscrow** | 2-3 | Pending → Funded → Released/Refunded | 6 gens |
| **TicTacToe** | 2 | Setup → Playing → Finished | 12 gens |
| **SimpleOrder** | 2 | Created → Confirmed → Shipped → Delivered | 8 gens |
| **ApprovalWorkflow** | 3-5 | Draft → Submitted → L1 → L2 → Approved | 10 gens |

### Workflow Transitions

Each workflow defines weighted transitions:

```typescript
// Contract example
{ from: 'Proposed', to: 'Active', event: 'accept', actor: 'counterparty', weight: 0.7 }
{ from: 'Proposed', to: 'Rejected', event: 'reject', actor: 'counterparty', weight: 0.3 }
{ from: 'Active', to: 'Completed', event: 'complete', actor: 'owner', weight: 0.85 }
{ from: 'Active', to: 'Disputed', event: 'dispute', actor: 'any', weight: 0.15 }
```

The mutation rate (default 8%) causes occasional unexpected transitions (e.g., accepting a contract that would normally be rejected) to simulate organic behavior.

## High-Throughput Mode

Designed for stress testing the indexer and explorer:

```bash
# Environment variables for high-throughput
TARGET_POPULATION=1000    # Number of agents
TARGET_TPS=10             # Target transactions per second
BATCH_SIZE=20             # Parallel transaction submissions
MAX_FIBERS_PER_TYPE=500   # Max concurrent fibers per workflow
GENERATION_INTERVAL_MS=1000  # 1 second generations
WORKFLOWS=AgentIdentity,Contract,Voting,TokenEscrow,TicTacToe,SimpleOrder,ApprovalWorkflow
```

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t ottochain-traffic-generator .
docker run -e BRIDGE_URL=http://host:3030 -e ML0_URL=http://host:9200 ottochain-traffic-generator
```

## Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { Simulator, type GeneratorConfig } from '@ottochain/traffic-generator';

const config: Partial<GeneratorConfig> = {
  targetPopulation: 10,
  generationIntervalMs: 5000,
  bridgeUrl: 'http://localhost:3030',
  ml0Url: 'http://localhost:9200',
};

const simulator = new Simulator(config, {
  onGenerationEnd: (stats) => {
    console.log(`Gen ${stats.generation}: ${stats.successes}/${stats.transactions} txns`);
  },
});

await simulator.start();

// Later...
simulator.stop();
```

## Generation Flow

Each generation:

1. **Population Dynamics**
   - Create new agents if below target (births)
   - Select low-fitness agents for withdrawal (deaths)

2. **Agent Activity**
   - Select active agents via fitness-weighted roulette
   - Each agent chooses transitions via softmax selection
   - Execute transitions on the metagraph

3. **Contract Lifecycle**
   - Propose new contracts (fitness-weighted counterparty selection)
   - Accept/reject pending proposals
   - Complete/dispute active contracts at expected completion time

4. **Fitness Updates**
   - Update all agent fitness scores
   - Decay temperature
   - Adjust market health based on success rate
